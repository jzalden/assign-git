What does fast-forward in Git mean?
	A fast-forward is a situation in which the current branch is ahead of master. Git can recognize this during a merge and fast-forward the master to match the current branch. At that time, the current branch can be deleted.
Why should you have different branches?
	An added feature may have too much content or be too diverse for a single commit. Creating a branch allows for a series of commits toward a single goal. It also allows for reverting said smaller-commits easily.
In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
	One per contributor and one for master.
